# Shut-the-Box-Game

## Description

    Shut the Box is a traditional dice game where players roll dice and cover numbers to match the roll. The goal is to cover all numbers from 1 to 12. This app brings the fun of Shut the Box to the web, providing an engaging user interface and easy gameplay.

## Features
    - Roll two dice and match the sum with numbers from 1 to 12.

    - Easy Mode for a more relaxed gameplay experience.

    - Confetti celebration on winning the game.

    - Responsive design (Work in progress for full mobile compatibility).
    
## Technologies Used
    - React

    - JavaScript

    - Nanoid for unique IDs

    - React Confetti for celebration effects
    
    - CSS for styling

## Lessons Learned
    - During the development of this app, I learned and improved upon several concepts:

    - State Management in React: Managing complex state across different components.

    - Effect Hooks: Using useEffect to trigger side effects in functional components.

    - Array Manipulation: Efficiently updating and managing array states.

    - Conditional Rendering: Dynamically rendering components based on state.

    - Game Logic Implementation: Translating the rules of a physical game into a digital    format.


## Future Improvements
    While the app is functional, there are several areas I'd like to improve:

    - Mobile Friendliness: Enhance the responsive design to ensure a seamless experience on mobile devices.

    - Accessibility: Ensure the app is accessible to users with disabilities by improving ARIA labels and keyboard navigation.

    -Enhanced UI/UX: Add animations and improve the overall design for a better user experience.
